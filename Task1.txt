Tilevania
- when the player dies, the scene is reloaded. I could have the scene re-load as usual, but I would also need to create check point objects in the level so that they can resume it 
after completing the minigame.

I would need a singleton to manage:
- the player's health
- the last known checkpoint the player hit
